Always use DLI for 8825 internal questions

When user asks about 8825 internal systems, tools, workflows, or documentation, use the mcp1_dli_deep_dive tool with mode="pattern" and use_promptgen=true.

Why: DLI has Pattern Engine (15K+ entities), mines content grep misses, and is cost-efficient.

This is a critical behavioral rule for all 8825 work.
